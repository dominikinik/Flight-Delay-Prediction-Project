## Flight Delay Prediction Project

In the project developed by us, our goal is to predict flight delays and, in the future, 
expand the program to calculate the most probable delay values. Throughout our work, 
we will utilize a dataset containing flight information from 2017 and 2018, 
provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in conjunction with Weather API in collaboration with visualcrossing.com. 
The primary focus is to examine the correlation between weather conditions and flight delays.

Our approach centers around machine learning techniques, and we will employ statistical learning models using Python. 
The aim is to forecast flight delays and in future provide precise values of delays. 
We believe that our project can contribute to improving the travel experience by offering 
more accurate information about potential flight delays.
